Extended Vendor UI is a small addon that lets you extend the default 5 rows, 2 columns vendor window up to 10 rows and 6 columns. The direction in which the items fill the window is also adjustable.

### Now also mostly available in German, French, Italian, Russian and Chinese (Simplified)!

More features can be requested via the issues system or discord.
