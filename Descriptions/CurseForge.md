<p>Extended Vendor UI is a small addon that lets you extend the default 5 rows, 2 columns vendor window up to 10 rows and 6 columns. The direction in which the items fill the window is also adjustable.</p>
<p><h3>Now also mostly available in German, French, Italian and Chinese (Simplified)!</h3></p>
<p>More features can be requested via the issues system or discord.</p>
